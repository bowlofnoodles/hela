## Install

This project requires [**Node.js**][nodeversion-url] **v6** and above. Use [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com) **v1** / [**npm**](https://npmjs.com) **v5** or above to install it.

```
$ yarn add hela
```

Or as development dependency

```
$ yarn add --dev hela
```

## Background

What is that? It is a package that is useful for automation and keeping things on one place.

It is meant to be used in `npm scripts`, but if you decide to use it as standalone tool
you still can. The core is pretty minimal, [really 80 lines](./src/index.js) without the documentation comments, but it has very flexible nature by embracing Shareable Configs (or also called "presets").

A working preset, you can see in use here (yes, `hela` uses itself and presets to release itself) and
in the first created preset - [hela-preset-tunnckocore][], which by the way uses itself **AND** `hela` too! It is pretty awesome, seriously.

Not only the presets gives us power. Hela uses pretty fantastic configuration loader, which is separated from the core as [pretty-config](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/pretty-config). It is similar to the very much used [cosmiconfig][], but is a lot more smaller (by implementation, by lines and by deps means) with great defaults and lookup on few places.

The `pretty-config` looks for this files to load configuration of some tool:

```js
const configFiles = [
  '.%src.json', // 1
  '.%src.yaml', // 2
  '.%src.yml', // 3
  '.%src.js', // 4
  '%s.config.js', // 5
  '.%s.config.js', // 6
  '.%src', // 7 - first try JSON, if fail to parse then fallback to YAML
  'package.json', // 8 - pkg.eslint || pkg.eslintConfig || pkg.config.eslint
]
```

Not to mention that it has support for adding more if needed.

For example, to load some preset, you can create `.helarc.json` with this,
where if you skip `hela-preset-` prefix it is assumed automatically.

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "foo",
    "hela-preset-bar",
    "tunnckocore",
    "./some/relative/JS-or-JSON-file.js"]
}
```

And so, above will resolve `hela-preset-foo`, `hela-preset-bar`, `hela-preset-tunnckocore` and
the tasks/presets from some given relative file. And everything is recursive.

Basically, `hela` just loops over an object of key/value pairs, where key is the name of a task and the value is a `string` (directly passed to `execa`), an `array` of strings (run in series passed to [execa][]) or a `function`.

If task is a function, then it is passed with `({ parse, argv, taskName, hela, helaExec, helaShell, ...options })` signature. Worth mentioning that it is called in a `promise.then()` and so the nextTick - be aware of that.

## Usage

Most easy to try it, is to install both `hela` and `hela-preset-tunnckocore` and run `hela style` on some project - it will format with Prettier and check with ESLint the files in `my-project/src/**/*.js`. 

### When project is using `hela` as npm scripts

Another way is to just clone this repository and run with `yarn` or `npm`

```
$ yarn build:cli
$ yarn start style
$ yarn start build
```

or if you just decide to contribute to some of the [@tunnckoCore projects](https://github.com/tunnckoCore) then you can just run

```
$ yarn commit
```

It will do what is needed and lead you to interactive prompt, which will ask you what you just implemented `feat`, `fix` or `chore` then a message and etc. We follow [Convetional Commits][ccommits-url] v1 specification.

### When project want to start using it

Before doing that you should choose some preset and you can just use `hela` directly without adding it to scripts, because it expose a CLI command called `hela` too.

For example, in [hela-preset-tunnckocore][] we (will) have `update` task. Thee job of that task is to just dangerously replace existing bits. By "replace" we mean that it will just read the `package.json` of the current working directory (CWD) and:

**1)** set four `npm scripts` to

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "hela",
    "test": "yarn start test",
    "precommit": "yarn start precommit",
    "commit": "yarn start commit"
  }
}
```

**2)** set `files` field to

```json
{
  "files": [
    "dist/"
  ]
}
```

**3)** create `.helarc.json` file in CWD

```json
{
  "presets": "tunnckocore"
}
```

**4)** set `devDependencies` field to (the only needed when using `tunnckocore` preset)

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-config-standard-tunnckocore": "^1.0.7",
    "hela-preset-tunnckocore": "^0.4.3",
    "husky": "^0.14.3",
    "mukla": "^0.4.9",
    "semantic-release": "^7.0.2"
  }
}
```

**5)** and optionally `engines` field to

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=6",
    "npm": ">=5",
    "yarn": ">=1"
  }
}
```

Nothing strange, right? It is some preset that is used by someone. The cool thing is that we can implement another very simple preset, for example called `hela-preset-init` which is more unopinionated
and will be suitable for every project. 

## Ideas

- `hela-preset-init` - unopinionated preset with one task: `hela init`
- `hela-preset-new-project` - project scaffolder

## API
Review carefully the provided examples and the working [tests](./test.js).
